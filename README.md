# HISN (حصن)

Network-level protection against phishing and fake websites. HISN acts as the DNS
server of a home network: every domain request is checked, and dangerous domains
are answered with the address of a block page.

> Status: Phase 2 (DNS server with whitelist, blacklist, verdict cache and decision log). See the project brief for the full roadmap.

## Setup

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate          # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
cp .env.example .env               # optional, defaults are safe for development
```

## Check the setup

```bash
python -c "from config import settings; print(settings.dns_host, settings.dns_port)"
```

Expected output: `127.0.0.1 5353`.

## Run the DNS server (development)

```bash
python -m dns_server.server
```

It listens on `127.0.0.1:5353` (UDP and TCP). Port 5353 needs no admin rights; port 53 is only for the real demo.
Stop it with `Ctrl+C`. If another program already uses port 5353, set `HISN_DNS_PORT` to a free port in `.env`.

Query it from a second terminal (works on every OS):

```bash
python -c "import sys; from dnslib import DNSRecord; print(DNSRecord.parse(DNSRecord.question(sys.argv[1]).send('127.0.0.1', 5353, timeout=5)))" absher-sa.com
```

Replace the last word with any domain. A blocked domain answers `127.0.0.1` (the block page address).
`nslookup -port=...` is not reliable on Windows (it may ignore the port), so use the command above.
On Linux and macOS `dig @127.0.0.1 -p 5353 absher-sa.com` also works.

Blocked domains get the block page address (`HISN_BLOCK_PAGE_IP`). Everything else is forwarded to the upstream DNS.
Edit `data/lists/whitelist.txt` and `data/lists/blacklist.txt`, then restart the server.

## Logs and privacy

Every decision is stored in a local SQLite file (`data/hisn.db`, never committed): time, domain,
verdict, reason and the client address. Nothing else (no URLs, no answers). Invalid queries are not logged.

- Entries older than `HISN_LOG_RETENTION_DAYS` (default 30) are deleted at startup and every hour.
- Delete old entries now: `python -m storage.db purge`
- Delete everything: `python -m storage.db delete-all --yes`

Daily allow/block totals contain no domains or devices, so they are kept when old entries are purged
and removed only by `delete-all`.

Verdicts for unknown domains are cached in memory for `HISN_VERDICT_CACHE_TTL` seconds. The cache is
checked after the whitelist and blacklist, so editing a list always wins over a cached verdict.
It stays empty until the ML model (a later phase) starts storing verdicts in it.

## Run the tests

```bash
python -m pytest
```

## Security notes

- Never commit `.env`, certificates, datasets or databases (see `.gitignore`).
- Run `pip-audit -r requirements.txt` before every release.
