# HISN (حصن)

Network-level protection against phishing and fake websites. HISN acts as the DNS
server of a home network: every domain request is checked, and dangerous domains
are answered with the address of a block page.

> Status: Phase 1 (DNS server with whitelist and blacklist). See the project brief for the full roadmap.

## Setup

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate          # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
cp .env.example .env               # optional, defaults are safe for development
```

## Check the setup

```bash
python -c "from config import settings; print(settings.dns_host, settings.dns_port)"
```

Expected output: `127.0.0.1 5353`.

## Run the DNS server (development)

```bash
python -m dns_server.server
```

It listens on `127.0.0.1:5353` (UDP and TCP). Port 5353 needs no admin rights; port 53 is only for the real demo.
Stop it with `Ctrl+C`. On Windows, if port 5353 is taken by another program, set `HISN_DNS_PORT=5354` in `.env`.

Query it from a second terminal:

```bash
nslookup -port=5353 absher-sa.com 127.0.0.1      # Windows (blocked: answers 127.0.0.1)
dig @127.0.0.1 -p 5353 absher-sa.com             # Linux / macOS
```

Blocked domains get the block page address (`HISN_BLOCK_PAGE_IP`). Everything else is forwarded to the upstream DNS.
Edit `data/lists/whitelist.txt` and `data/lists/blacklist.txt`, then restart the server.

## Run the tests

```bash
python -m pytest
```

## Security notes

- Never commit `.env`, certificates, datasets or databases (see `.gitignore`).
- Run `pip-audit -r requirements.txt` before every release.
